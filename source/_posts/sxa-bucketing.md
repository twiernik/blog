Some time ago I was creating POC using SXA. Just before demo there were requests to make small changes into the project.
One of them was to change bucketing rules as we really didn't want to have second specific granurality.

While I've worked with Sitecore for several months only this task looked pretty easy.. until I tried to actually do that.
I've played with buckets before but this time things didn't well as I wasn't able to enforce new bucketing rule.

After at least two hours I asked my peers for help, some were as baffled as me but those more familiar with SXA told me that each site has its own bucketing rules.
Knowing this I've ended the task in about 5 minutes but I felt something needs to be done with this to save other developers time.

As a result I've created content warning for 'standard' bucket settings which I think will be very helpfull while you will be learning how to work with SXA.
